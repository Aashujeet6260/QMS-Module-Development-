Of course. You are right to prioritize the specific points from the interview task document. I will now generate a new `README.md` file that is structured to directly answer each of your submission requirements in order.

This version is written as a formal submission document, with your required points as the main sections.

# QMS Module - Interview Task Submission

This repository contains the complete, full-stack solution for the QMS Module Development interview task. The project is a web application designed for managing quality events in a Life Science context, built with a React frontend, a Python FastAPI backend, and an integrated AI assistant powered by Google Gemini.

## 1. Setup and Installation Instructions

This section covers the setup for both the frontend and backend components of the application.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* **Node.js** (v18 or newer)
* **Python** (v3.9 or newer)
* **Docker Desktop** (must be running)

### Backend Setup

The backend requires a single environment variable for the Google Gemini API key.

1.  Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
2.  Create a new file named `.env`.
3.  Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual key from Google AI Studio:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```

### Frontend Setup

All frontend dependencies are managed by `npm`.

1.  Open a terminal in the root `qms-project` folder.
2.  Run the following command to install all necessary Node.js packages for the frontend:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## 2. Instructions on How to Run the Application

The project is configured to run with two simple commands from the root directory.

1.  **Build the Backend Container:** This command uses Docker to build a containerized image of the FastAPI server. This needs to be run once, or whenever backend code or dependencies change.
    ```bash
    npm run build-backend
    ```
2.  **Start the Application:** This command starts both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    * The backend server will run inside Docker on port `8000`.
    * The frontend development server will be available at **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**.

### First-Time Use

The application features a full authentication system. Upon first visiting the site, you will be directed to the login page. You must first **Sign Up** for a new account to be able to log in and use the application's features.

## 3. Design Choices & Assumptions

This section provides a brief explanation of the key architectural and design choices made during development.

### Architecture
* A **monorepo structure** was used to keep the frontend and backend code together in a single repository for easier management and versioning.
* The backend is **containerized with Docker** to provide a consistent, isolated, and reliable runtime environment. This choice was critical in overcoming local machine inconsistencies and ensures the application runs the same way everywhere.

### Technology Choices
* **Backend:** **FastAPI** was selected for its high performance, asynchronous capabilities, and excellent developer experience with features like automatic documentation and data validation powered by **Pydantic**. **SQLAlchemy** was used as the ORM for database interaction, with **SQLite** chosen for its simplicity in a development/prototyping context.
* **Frontend:** **React** (with **Vite**) was chosen for its component-based architecture and fast development server. **Redux Toolkit** was implemented for robust and scalable state management, which is essential for handling complex application state like authentication, event data, and filters. **Tailwind CSS** was used to build a professional, consistent, and responsive UI efficiently. Styling is centralized in `tailwind.config.js` and a global `index.css` file for maintainability.

### Assumptions
* **Role Permissions:** The application implements three distinct user roles (`Operator`, `Investigator`, `QA Approver`) at the data level. However, it is assumed that for this task, a full, granular permission system (e.g., preventing an `Operator` from deleting an event) was not required. The backend is protected, requiring any logged-in user to perform actions, but does not yet differentiate by role.
* **Filtering:** Event filtering is currently handled on the client-side within the Redux state. This is a performant approach for a moderate number of events. It is assumed that for a production application with a very large dataset, this logic would be moved to the backend API with database-level querying and pagination.

## 4. Implemented AI Features

The application features an integrated AI Assistant on the main pages, powered by Google Gemini. It is designed to enhance user interaction and provide actionable insights. The following five distinct tools are available through a natural language interface:

* **üîç Smart Filter & Query Engine**
    * **Objective:** Allows users to find specific events using natural language.
    * **Example Prompts:** `"Show all open deviations"`, `"Find events reported by Charlie Brown last month."`

* **üìà Trend & Pattern Analysis**
    * **Objective:** Analyzes the complete event dataset to identify recurring issues and potential systemic problems.
    * **Example Prompts:** `"What are the main trends in our quality events?"`, `"Is there a common root cause for issues in the Manufacturing department?"`

* **‚û°Ô∏è Next Step Advisor**
    * **Objective:** Provides clear, actionable guidance for a specific event.
    * **Example Prompts:** `"Suggest the next steps for event DEV-2025-001."`, `"What is the standard investigation plan for a documentation error?"`

* **‚úçÔ∏è Communication Assistant**
    * **Objective:** Helps users draft professional and consistent communications related to QMS events.
    * **Example Prompts:** `"Draft an email to stakeholders for the closure of an audit."`, `"Write a brief summary of DEV-2025-003 for a meeting."`

* **üß† Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Assistant**
    * **Objective:** Guides a user through the problem-solving process to identify the true root cause of an event.
    * **Example Prompts:** `"Help me find the root cause of the temperature deviation."`, `"What are potential causes for a batch failing its purity test?"`
